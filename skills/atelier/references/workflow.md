# Workflow

The four-check loop, coverage gates, lint discipline, and the editor/CI rules that keep them enforced. Run through this after every code change; nothing ships until it is clean.

## The four-check loop (after every change)

```bash
bun test           # must pass
bun run lint       # 0 errors AND 0 warnings
bun run typecheck  # tsc --noEmit, clean
bun run coverage   # per-directory thresholds pass
```

If any of the four fail, fix the cause and re-run all four. Do not move on while one is red. Warnings have repeatedly hidden real issues (silent precedence bugs, dead returns, suppressed scanners); the zero-warning rule is not cosmetic.

`package.json` scripts:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "lint": "eslint --cache",
    "lint:strict": "LINT_STRICT=1 eslint",
    "typecheck": "tsc --noEmit",
    "coverage": "bun run scripts/check-coverage.ts"
  }
}
```

`bun run lint:strict` (~25 s) sets the env var `LINT_STRICT=1`; the same `eslint.config.js` reads `process.env['LINT_STRICT']` and conditionally adds a type-aware block (`parserOptions.projectService: true` plus `@typescript-eslint/no-unnecessary-type-assertion` and `@typescript-eslint/prefer-promise-reject-errors`). One config file, two modes — no separate `eslint.strict.config.js` to keep in sync. The pre-commit hook (gate 5) runs the strict version; trust the hook for the inner loop.

## Zero warnings; no inline ignores

`bun run lint` is considered failing if it reports any warnings, not just errors. Two acceptable ways to clear a finding:

1. **Refactor the code** so the rule no longer fires. This is the default. If Snyk's string-literal-adjacent-to-key heuristic flags `const apiKey = 'sk-...'`, build the value at runtime from env vars. If `no-await-in-loop` fires, restructure the loop into `Promise.all` or accept the sequential cost with a targeted severity change.
2. **Configure rule severity at the project level** in `eslint.config.js`, with a comment explaining why. Reserved for rules that produce only false positives in this codebase's idioms — branded types, string-literal unions, bounded regexes, `security/detect-object-injection` on `Record<K, V>` lookups. For security-plugin rules, the two-part test below must be satisfied before disabling. Atelier already does this with `unicorn/no-null`, `unicorn/empty-brace-spaces`, `security/detect-object-injection`, `security/detect-unsafe-regex`, and `security/detect-non-literal-fs-filename`.

**Forbidden everywhere, no exceptions:**

- `// eslint-disable`, `// eslint-disable-next-line`, `// eslint-disable-line`
- `// @ts-ignore`, `// @ts-expect-error`
- `// deepcode ignore`, `// snyk-ignore`, `// sonar-ignore`, `// istanbul ignore`
- Any equivalent from another tool

If a rule needs suppression for a single line, the suppression is a lie — either the rule is wrong for this codebase (change severity at the project level) or the code is wrong for this codebase (refactor). A per-line suppression hides both.

### Project-level rule disabling: a two-part test

Before adding a rule to the `'off'` list, both of these must be true:

1. **Every fire in this codebase is a false positive for our idioms.** Not "most", not "the current ones". Branded types + `Record<K, V>` lookups, bounded regexes with documented inputs, `chmodSync(mkdtempSync(...))` inside FS-adapter tests — these never represent a real exploit in the atelier style. If even one fire out of ten is a genuine finding, leave the rule on and refactor the other nine.
2. **The pattern the rule would catch if it fired correctly is something the production code cannot produce.** `security/detect-non-literal-fs-filename` matters for `node:fs` calls in production; atelier production code uses `Bun.file` instead (which the rule does not watch), so disabling globally loses nothing on the real attack surface. If production *could* produce the pattern, disabling masks a real vulnerability class.

Never disable a rule globally just to silence a single test, a single commit, or a single file. If the fire is localised, the right tool is a narrower `files:` scope in the ESLint config (disable the rule for `**/*.test.ts` only, for example) — still at the project level, still with a comment, never inline.

## Coverage gates (per-tier, enforced by custom script)

Bun's built-in `coverageThreshold` is a single global number. It cannot express "100% on the domain, 80% on infra, skipped on test-helpers". The repo enforces per-tier rules via `scripts/check-coverage.ts`, which runs `bun test --coverage`, parses the text report, and applies path-prefix rules.

A ready-to-copy `check-coverage.ts` lives in the skill at `assets/check-coverage.ts`. It exposes `COVERAGE_RULES` and `SKIPPED` as top-of-file constants so tuning per-project takes a one-line edit.

| Path | Threshold (functions & lines) |
|:---|:---|
| `src/domain/**` | **100%** |
| `src/use-cases/**` (including `ports/`) | **100%** |
| `src/composition/**` (env.ts AND build-deps.ts) | **80%** |
| `src/presenter/**` | 80% |
| `src/infra/**` | **80% from day one** — not "once tests exist" |
| `src/test-helpers/**` | skip during normal runs (audit periodically — see below) |
| `src/main.ts` | skip (entry point; verified by integration) |

**`build-deps.ts` is no longer skipped.** The earlier policy excluded it as "composition root, verified live, no logic worth unit-testing". That was hedging. The composition root becomes fully unit-testable when (a) every "where do I read state from" point (file path, env var, system clock) is parameterisable, and (b) every "what do I write to / log to" sink can be injected as a port. See `references/architecture.md` (Composition root testability) for the optional-config-DI pattern.

Every `src/infra/*.ts`, `src/composition/env.ts`, and `src/presenter/cli.ts` carries a real 80% gate — most end up at 100% once the three infra-test patterns (see `references/testing.md`) are in routine use. The "we'll add infra tests later" road leads to a coverage gate that trivially passes.

`bun run coverage` exits non-zero if any file falls below its gate and prints the offending paths with current-vs-required numbers. A tier summary at the end highlights the worst funcs/lines per tier, so a single sloppy file is visible without scrolling the per-file table.

If a file cannot hit the gate, the fix is usually **restructure the code so the dead branch goes away**, not lower the threshold. A threshold reduction must be justified in the commit message.

### The coverage preload (mandatory)

`bun test --coverage` only reports rows for files the test runner imports. Untested infra files — no `*.test.ts`, no test imports them — are silently absent from the table, which makes the per-file gate trivially pass. Every adapter you forgot to test becomes invisible instead of failing loudly.

The fix is a preload file that side-effect-imports every infra, composition, and presenter module, so they appear in the coverage table at 0% if no test exercises them. A ready-to-copy template lives in the skill at `assets/coverage-preload.ts`.

```ts
// scripts/coverage-preload.ts
// This file forces every module that belongs under a coverage gate to appear
// in `bun test --coverage` output, even when no test imports it. Without this,
// an untested adapter is silently absent and the per-file gate passes.
//
// RULE: every new file in src/infra/, src/composition/, or src/presenter/
// must be added here in the same commit. Enforced by code review.

import '../src/infra/logger.ts';
import '../src/infra/sheets-google.ts';
import '../src/infra/telegram-http.ts';
// ... one line per infra / composition / presenter file
import '../src/composition/env.ts';
import '../src/presenter/cli.ts';
```

**Wire it at coverage time only — NOT in `bunfig.toml`.** `scripts/check-coverage.ts` spawns:

```bash
bun test --coverage --preload ./scripts/coverage-preload.ts
```

Do not put `preload = [...]` under `[test]` in `bunfig.toml`. The preload pulls in heavy runtime deps (e.g. `googleapis`, `winston`, `twitter-api-v2`, `@ai-sdk/google`) that would add 1–2 seconds to every plain `bun test`. Loading it only at coverage time keeps the inner-loop fast without losing the gate.

**Maintenance rule:** every new file in `src/infra/`, `src/composition/`, or `src/presenter/` must be added to `coverage-preload.ts` in the same commit. Reviewers check this explicitly. A pre-commit lint could enforce it automatically; not done yet, so it is a review obligation.

### `bunfig.toml`: minimal, no `coverageThreshold`, no `preload`

The global `coverageThreshold` in `bunfig.toml` must be **absent** when the per-tier script owns enforcement. If set, Bun exits non-zero on the global threshold before the script runs, the script's first line (`if (result.status !== 0) return result.status`) bails, and the per-file violation breakdown never prints. The operator sees `error: script "coverage" exited with code 1` with no useful diagnostic.

`preload` must also be absent under `[test]` — see above.

Correct `bunfig.toml`:

```toml
[test]
coverage = true
coverageSkipTestFiles = true
coverageReporter = ["text"]
# NOTE: no `coverageThreshold` here — per-tier enforcement is in
# scripts/check-coverage.ts.
# NOTE: no `preload` here — the coverage preload is loaded only by
# `bun run coverage` (via --preload on the spawned bun-test command),
# so plain `bun test` runs stay fast.
```

When introducing a per-tier coverage gate in an existing repo, remove any global `coverageThreshold` *and* any `preload` from `bunfig.toml` in the same change.

## SonarLint findings caught at lint time

SonarLint runs IDE-side; CI and pre-commit do not see it. To keep IDE-only findings from drifting back in, ESLint is wired to catch them at lint time.

In `eslint.config.js` (one config, two modes — `LINT_STRICT=1` switches on the type-aware block):

```js
import pluginJs from '@eslint/js';
import sonarjsPlugin from 'eslint-plugin-sonarjs';
import securityPlugin from 'eslint-plugin-security';
import tsPlugin from 'typescript-eslint';

export default [
  pluginJs.configs.recommended,
  ...tsPlugin.configs.recommended,
  securityPlugin.configs.recommended,
  {
    files: ['**/*.ts'],
    rules: {
      'no-restricted-imports': ['error', {
        paths: [{
          name: 'bun:test',
          importNames: ['mock'],
          message:
            '`mock` from bun:test is forbidden — it leaks across test files. Use dependency injection: refactor the production code to accept the SDK as a parameter, then pass a fake at construction.',
        }],
      }],
    },
  },
  // Type-aware rules — gated by LINT_STRICT=1. Inner-loop `bun run lint`
  // does not pay the ~25s parserOptions.projectService cost.
  ...(process.env['LINT_STRICT']
    ? [{
        files: ['src/**/*.ts'],
        languageOptions: {
          parserOptions: {
            projectService: true,
            tsconfigRootDir: import.meta.dirname,
          },
        },
        rules: {
          '@typescript-eslint/no-unnecessary-type-assertion': 'error',
          '@typescript-eslint/prefer-promise-reject-errors': 'error',
        },
      }]
    : []),
  sonarjsPlugin.configs.recommended,
  {
    // SonarJS rule overrides — always-on, justified per rule.
    rules: {
      'sonarjs/no-unused-vars': 'off',          // duplicates @typescript-eslint/no-unused-vars
      'sonarjs/no-empty-test-file': 'off',      // false positives on `describe` test layout
      'sonarjs/cognitive-complexity': 'off',    // function-size cap already covers this
    },
  },
  {
    rules: {
      'security/detect-object-injection': 'off',
      'security/detect-unsafe-regex': 'off',
      // false-positive on chmodSync(mkdtempSync(...)) in FS-adapter tests;
      // production uses Bun.file (not covered by this rule), so no real loss.
      'security/detect-non-literal-fs-filename': 'off',
    },
  },
];
```

The conditional block runs only when `process.env['LINT_STRICT']` is set, so the inner-loop `bun run lint` skips it entirely. `bun run lint:strict` is just `LINT_STRICT=1 eslint`.

### Common SonarJS findings and how to fix them

| Sonar ID | Symptom | Fix (never suppress) |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **S4325** | `x!` non-null assertion, or `x as Type` without real narrowing | Replace with a guard clause: `const found = xs.find(...); if (!found) throw new Error(...); return found;` |
| **S6594** | `"abc".match(re)` used for captured groups | Use `re.exec("abc")` — more efficient, avoids the global-flag trap |
| **S4123** | `await` on a matcher chain that is not a real `Thenable`, e.g. `await expect(p).rejects.toThrow()` | Use the `captureRejection(promise)` helper — see `references/result-type.md` |
| **S6551** | `String(err)` in a catch block | Use the shared `formatError(err: unknown): string` from `src/domain/utilities/format-error.ts` |
| **S6671** | `Promise.reject(value)` where value is not an `Error` | Change to `Promise.reject(new Error(...))`. For tests that deliberately reject with a non-Error, use a tiny `async (v: unknown) => { throw v }` helper |
| **sonarjs/void-use** | `void unusedParam;` to silence unused-var warnings | Drop the parameter entirely from the implementation. TypeScript's function-type **parameter contravariance** means a function with fewer parameters is assignable to a function-type with more. |

### Types must not lie

`Record<K, V>` says "every key maps to V". JavaScript's runtime says otherwise — missing keys return `undefined`. If the key set is open (user IDs, row IDs, environment variables), the honest type is `Partial<Record<K, V>>`.

```ts
// BAD - the type lies
type SheetRow = Readonly<Record<string, string>>;
const value = row['maybe-absent']; // typed as string, actually undefined

// GOOD - the type tells the truth
type SheetRow = Readonly<Partial<Record<string, string>>>;
const value = row['maybe-absent'] ?? ''; // typed as string | undefined, narrowed at use
```

Every consumer that did `value !== undefined` on the first form was calling a check the type said could never be false. The `Partial` form makes the check real.

## Pre-commit hook (eight gates)

The hook is the safety net for the entire workflow. It runs **eight gates** in cost-ascending order — cheap fast-fail gates first, expensive gates last so a slow mutation run only happens when everything else is clean.

| # | Gate | Purpose | Typical time |
|:--:|:---|:---|:--:|
| 1 | `scripts/check-commit-size.sh` | ≤10 files AND ≤300 lines | <1s |
| 2 | `scripts/check-package-json.sh` | no `"latest"` or `"*"` version strings | <1s |
| 3 | `gitleaks protect --staged` | secret scan on the staged diff | ~50ms |
| 4 | `bun test` | unit tests pass | seconds |
| 5 | `bun run lint:strict` | type-aware ESLint, 0 errors AND 0 warnings | ~25s |
| 6 | `bun run typecheck` | `tsc --noEmit` clean | seconds |
| 7 | `bun run coverage` | per-tier thresholds pass | seconds |
| 8 | `bun run mutate:staged` | ≥90% mutation score on staged domain/use-case files | 1–3 min per staged file |

A ready-to-copy script lives in the skill at `assets/pre-commit`. The companion scripts (`check-commit-size.sh`, `check-package-json.sh`, `mutate-staged.sh`, `mutate-changed.sh`) live alongside it.

### Install once per clone

```bash
mkdir -p .githooks scripts
cp <skill>/assets/pre-commit .githooks/pre-commit
cp <skill>/assets/check-commit-size.sh scripts/check-commit-size.sh
cp <skill>/assets/check-package-json.sh scripts/check-package-json.sh
cp <skill>/assets/mutate-staged.sh scripts/mutate-staged.sh
cp <skill>/assets/mutate-changed.sh scripts/mutate-changed.sh
cp <skill>/assets/stryker.conf.json stryker.conf.json
chmod +x .githooks/pre-commit scripts/*.sh
git config core.hooksPath .githooks
```

Add to `package.json`:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "mutate": "stryker run",
    "mutate:changed": "bash scripts/mutate-changed.sh",
    "mutate:staged": "bash scripts/mutate-staged.sh"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "@stryker-mutator/core": "^9.6.1"
  }
}
```

Install gitleaks (optional but recommended): `brew install gitleaks` on macOS, or grab a binary from `github.com/gitleaks/gitleaks/releases`. The hook degrades gracefully if `gitleaks` is missing — it warns and continues — so first-time clones don't break.

The `git config core.hooksPath .githooks` is the one step that is easy to forget. Without it, Git looks in `.git/hooks/` and your commit goes through unchecked. Document it in the repo's `README.md` install section.

### Commit size limits (gate 1)

`scripts/check-commit-size.sh` blocks any commit exceeding **10 files OR 300 lines** (insertions + deletions). The thresholds are conservative because they force the discipline; loosening them undermines the rule.

Why:
- Small commits are easier to review, revert, and bisect.
- Large commits hide bugs (one slip across 300 lines is hard to spot).
- Every commit on `main` becomes git history that the next engineer reads — keep each one a coherent slice.

When working on a feature, **commit as you go** — one focused slice at a time. The gate is the safety net, not the policy.

### Dependency hygiene (gate 2)

`scripts/check-package-json.sh` blocks any commit where `package.json` declares a version as `"latest"` or `"*"`. Every entry under `dependencies`, `devDependencies`, and `peerDependencies` must use a concrete version (`X.Y.Z`) or a real range (`^X.Y.Z`, `~X.Y.Z`, `>=X.Y.Z`).

Why:
- `"latest"` and `"*"` are non-deterministic. `bun install` on different days gives different `node_modules/` trees. The lockfile only partially mitigates this.
- The literal string `"latest"` semantically signals "always upgrade" — a silent-break footgun that can pull in a major version change between two checkouts of the same commit.
- You don't audit what you didn't expect to install. Hidden upgrades from `"latest"` are how supply-chain attacks land.

Workflow:

- **Adding a package.** `bun add <pkg>` (runtime) or `bun add -d <pkg>` (dev). Bun resolves the actual latest version at install time and writes it as `^X.Y.Z`. **Never hand-edit `package.json` to add a dep** — the gate may pass on a manually-typed `^1.2.3`, but you lose the auto-pinning convention and the muscle memory drifts.
- **Bumping every dep to current latest.** Run `bun update`. This rewrites the existing `^X.Y.Z` ranges to the latest matching versions and updates `bun.lock`. Commit both files in the same change. Do this on a deliberate cadence (start of a release, dependabot-style cron, etc.), not silently on every commit.
- **Bumping one specific dep.** `bun update <pkg>` for a constrained bump, or `bun add <pkg>@latest` to force the absolute current latest into the same `^X.Y.Z` slot. Either way, no `"latest"` ends up in the file.
- **Initial scaffold.** When using the skill's `package.json` skeleton (in `references/bun-typescript.md`), the version ranges are samples. Run `bun install` to resolve them, then `bun update` to pull each dep to its current latest, then commit both files together. Verify with `bash scripts/check-package-json.sh`.

The gate runs `grep -nE '"\*"|"latest"' package.json`. It catches the two bare strings only — version ranges like `^1.2.3` and `>=4.0.0` pass.

### Secret scanning with gitleaks (gate 3)

The hook runs `gitleaks protect --staged --redact --verbose --no-banner`. Two distinct gitleaks modes — pick the right one:

- **`gitleaks protect --staged`** — scans the staged-but-not-committed diff. Fast (~50 ms). Blocks re-introduction of secrets *before* they enter history. Use in pre-commit hooks.
- **`gitleaks detect`** — scans the entire git history (every commit, every file ever). Slow. Use for periodic audits or CI checks. **Does not** belong in a pre-commit hook.

Run `gitleaks detect` once before the first push to GitHub to catch anything that snuck in pre-hook.

### Mutation testing with Stryker (gate 8)

[Stryker](https://stryker-mutator.io/) generates small "mutants" of the production code (e.g. `>` becomes `>=`, `&&` becomes `||`, `return x` becomes `return undefined`) and runs the test suite against each. A mutant that survives means your tests don't actually pin the behaviour they appear to.

The atelier policy: **every staged file under `src/domain/**` or `src/use-cases/**` must score ≥90% mutation score** before commit. The threshold is the `break` value in `stryker.conf.json`.

```jsonc
{
  "packageManager": "npm",
  "testRunner": "command",
  "commandRunner": { "command": "bun test" },
  "mutate": [
    "src/domain/**/*.ts",
    "src/use-cases/**/*.ts",
    "!**/*.test.ts",
    "!**/ports/**"
  ],
  "thresholds": { "high": 95, "low": 90, "break": 90 },
  "incremental": true,
  "incrementalFile": "reports/stryker-incremental.json",
  "concurrency": 4,
  "timeoutMS": 30000,
  "tempDirName": ".stryker-tmp",
  "cleanTempDir": true,
  "ignorePatterns": [
    ".claude/", ".agents/", ".githooks/", ".vscode/", ".git/",
    "docs/", "prompts/", "scripts/", "reports/", ".stryker-tmp/",
    "node_modules/", "*.md", "*.toml", "*.lock", "*.json"
  ]
}
```

There is no native Bun runner today, so we use the command runner — Stryker shells out to `bun test` once per mutant (~7 s on a typical codebase). `incremental: true` caches per-mutant results so unchanged code is not re-tested. `packageManager: "npm"` is needed because Stryker probes for a JS-ecosystem package manager and does not yet recognise Bun's lockfile. `ignorePatterns` skips non-source dirs from the sandbox copy — `.claude/` in particular often contains a symlink Stryker cannot copy (ENOTSUP).

**Three commands, three scopes:**

- **`bun run mutate`** — full run on `src/domain/**` + `src/use-cases/**`. Slow (1–2 hr on ~150 files). Periodic audit.
- **`bun run mutate:changed`** — files differing from `origin/main` plus uncommitted edits. Run during iteration. Override base ref with `BASE=HEAD~3 bun run mutate:changed`.
- **`bun run mutate:staged`** — files staged for the next commit. Used by gate 8. Skips with exit 0 when no relevant files are staged, so commits to docs, tests, or scripts are unaffected.

**Mutation scope is exactly `src/domain/**` + `src/use-cases/**`, with only two structural exclusions:**

1. `**/*.test.ts` — test files have no logic to mutate
2. `**/ports/**` — port files are type-only declarations (zero runtime, zero mutants)

**No file gets a per-file exclusion just because its tests feel awkward.** If a file produces equivalent or timing-flaky mutants, the right answer is one of:

1. Tighten the test (assert the specific behaviour the mutant breaks).
2. Refactor the production code to be more directly testable (extract pure helpers from a dispatch loop, etc.).
3. Improve fixtures so timing isn't load-bearing.

Skip lists rot — the next person assumes a file was untestable when really it was just inconvenient that day. If you're tempted to exclude a file, that's a smell — fix the test instead.

ESLint must ignore `.stryker-tmp/` and `reports/` so Stryker scratch dirs do not get linted (see `references/bun-typescript.md`).

### Periodic audit: surface dead code in `test-helpers`

`src/test-helpers/**` is in the normal coverage skip list because it is test infrastructure, not production code. But that means **dead helpers can sit there at <100% indefinitely**. The fix is a periodic audit:

Once per release (or quarterly), temporarily remove the `test-helpers` skip from `scripts/check-coverage.ts` and run `bun run coverage`. Anything below 100% is one of two things:

1. **Dead code.** Delete it. Coverage gaps are a YAGNI smell-detector. (Real example: `networkThrow(message)` in `fetch-mock.ts` was a speculative helper that no test ever called — every test inlined `respond: () => { throw new TypeError(...) }` instead. Deleted.)
2. **Untested defensive code** (e.g. `installFetchMock`'s "no handler matched" guard). Add a one-test smoke block — they're load-bearing even when normal tests don't hit them.

Restore the skip after the audit. Schedule it on a calendar; the longer between audits, the more dead code accumulates.

### Never bypass with `--no-verify`

`git commit --no-verify` skips every gate. It is reserved for genuine big-bang changes — initial scaffolds, mass-rename refactors, generated-file updates — never for a failing check. **Justify every bypass in the commit body.** Do not normalise bypassing.

If a check is wrong for the codebase, fix it at the project level — raise or lower a rule's severity in `eslint.config.js`, adjust a coverage gate in `scripts/check-coverage.ts`, refactor a flaky test — and commit the fix. Same discipline as the no-inline-ignore rule: refactor or reconfigure, never suppress.

### Adapt for Husky or another hook manager

If the repo already uses Husky, drop the body of `assets/pre-commit` (from `set -euo pipefail` onwards) into `.husky/pre-commit`. The shebang and the `git config core.hooksPath` step are unnecessary; Husky handles them.

## README consistency

After completing any change that touches user-visible behaviour, re-read `README.md` and update it to match. Previous breakages:

- CLI flags renamed but `--flow` examples stayed
- Scripts added to `package.json` but not listed
- Folders deleted (or renamed) but the architecture diagram still referenced them
- Coverage and prompt sections missing entirely from a change set that introduced them

**Checklist before declaring any task done:**

1. `bun test` — passes
2. `bun run lint` — 0 errors AND 0 warnings (fast, ~2 s cached / ~7 s cold)
3. `bun run typecheck` — clean
4. `bun run coverage` — per-directory gates pass
5. `README.md` — re-read, consistent with the change set

## Editor configuration that keeps formatting stable

Two guardrails prevent Prettier ↔ VS Code TS-formatter drift:

1. `.vscode/settings.json` routes `[typescript]` and `[javascript]` overrides to `dbaeumer.vscode-eslint` so the editor never re-formats with TS's own rules.
2. The pre-commit hook runs the full four-check loop, catching any drift at commit time.

```json
// .vscode/settings.json
{
  "editor.formatOnSave": true,
  "editor.defaultFormatter": "dbaeumer.vscode-eslint",
  "editor.codeActionsOnSave": {
    "source.fixAll.eslint": "explicit"
  },
  "[typescript]": { "editor.defaultFormatter": "dbaeumer.vscode-eslint" },
  "[javascript]": { "editor.defaultFormatter": "dbaeumer.vscode-eslint" },
  "[typescriptreact]": { "editor.defaultFormatter": "dbaeumer.vscode-eslint" }
}
```

## TypeScript config for VS Code + Bun interop

`bun run typecheck` (invoking `tsc --noEmit`) finds the `bun:test` module via type-acquisition heuristics. VS Code's TypeScript server does not, and errors `Cannot find module 'bun:test'`. Fix with an explicit `"types"` array in `tsconfig.json`:

```jsonc
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "types": ["bun"]
    // ... rest of config
  }
}
```

After the change, restart the TS server in VS Code (Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + P → "TypeScript: Restart TS Server"). The CLI typecheck passes either way; the editor needs the explicit list.

## Summary

- **Inner-loop checks, always, in order:** `bun test`, `bun run lint`, `bun run typecheck`, `bun run coverage`.
- **Zero warnings, zero inline ignores.** Refactor or change severity at the project level; never suppress per-line.
- **Coverage gates per-tier:** 100% on `domain` + `use-cases`, 80% on `composition` + `infra` + `presenter`, skip `test-helpers` and `main.ts` only. `build-deps.ts` is now in scope (testable via optional config DI).
- **SonarLint parity at lint time** via `eslint-plugin-sonarjs` + type-aware `@typescript-eslint` rules.
- **Pre-commit hook runs eight gates**, in cost-ascending order: commit size → package.json (no `"latest"` / `"*"`) → gitleaks → tests → lint:strict → typecheck → coverage → mutate:staged.
- **Mutation testing on staged files** (Stryker, ≥90% break threshold) makes "tests don't actually pin behaviour" findable in CI.
- **Commits stay small:** ≤10 files AND ≤300 lines per commit. The hook enforces it.
- **Periodic audits**: once per release, drop the `test-helpers` skip and run coverage; anything below 100% is dead code or untested defensive code.
- **README.md is part of the change set.** Re-read it before declaring any task done.
